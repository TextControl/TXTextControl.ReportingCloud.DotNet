## Username and password for unittests

The ReportingCloud PHP wrapper ships with a number of .NET unit tests. The scripts in each of these directories require a username and password for ReportingCloud in order to be executed. So that your username and password are not made inadvertently publicly available via a public GIT repository, you will first need to specify them.
